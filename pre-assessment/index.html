    <h2>My Assessment</h2> <!---Hey Thomas!-->
    <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity. Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
    <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
    <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>

    <p>The "alt" and "title" attributes are used for images and "title" can also be used for anchors. Alt stands for alternative text and provides a meaningful description for screen reader users. Title attributes provide additional information and shows as a tooltip.</p>
