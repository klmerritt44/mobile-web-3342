        <h2>Final Project Reflection (Hocott's Garden Center Website)</h2>
        <p>I decided to create a website for a local business, Hocott's Garden Center.</p>
        <p><strong>The purpose of the website is to:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>increase visibility from online traffic</li>
          <li>promote landscaping services</li>
          <li>build a distinct brand identity</li>
          <li>educate customers</li>
          <li>facilitate in-store visits</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>3342 Course Reflection</h2>
        <p>The Information Technology department has been a game-changer for me! Pursuing these web classes for my professional development has been incredibly rewarding, both professionally and personally. </p>
        <p>Looking back on this course, I've come along way in understanding mobile-web design and modern development approaches. I found myself wrestling with the process and struggling to get over some internal anxiety at times, the journey has been invaluable! Now, I can confidently navigate through the web development process and communicate what I need from clients. </p>
        <p>This semester I've taken it a step further with using the Inspector tool for troubleshooting and experimentation. Initially, navigating through code and identifying issues felt daunting, but with practice, I've gained confidence in using this tool effectively. It's made the css styling process so much easier! I've also been able to use the inspector to test different screen sizes, and it's helped me get a better understanding of how to use and test my CSS media queries.</p>
        <p>Embracing new tools and techniques in general has been pivotal in my journey as a web developer, and I'm excited to continue expanding my skills and knowledge in this dynamic field.</p>
        <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Refine My HTML Boilerplate Template and Workflow</li>
          <p>You know I enjoy coding HTML and I want my boilerplate to be just so, but I haven't finessed it totally. My goal is to regularly update and customize it as I gain new skills and preferences. I don't like having a lot of code that I don't understand. It adds to the overwhelm, so I'd like to dig into the HTML Boilerplate documentation more to ease my anxiety and better understand the extra files and the css media queries and helper classes. This brings me to my second area of improvement.</p>
          <li>Embrace the "messy middle" and experiment!</li>
          <p>It's okay to make mistakes! I'm trying to get more comfortable embracing imperfection in the coding process to facilitate learning. I think this has contributed to me getting hung up and having trouble getting started on my web projects.</p>
          <li>Master Rapid Prototyping with Bootstrap</li>
          <p>I struggled with changing my ways of coding to implement bootstrap. I understand the concept of using the bootstrap classes to implement their external stylesheet, but goodness did it get overwhelming with all the documentation. I wish I would have given myself more time to play with it and ask questions in class. I'm kind of afraid to go back and look at it, so I know I need to.</p>
          <li>Cultivate My Developer Mindset and Give Grace to Myself</li>
          <p>Having a positive mindset is so important in our line of work, and I'm realizing that even more so now. I started getting over the sense of not fitting in, but negative self-talk still remains a challenge. I committed myself to the journey, striking a balance between perseverance and self-acceptance, but it can be difficult. I need to continue to developing a positive mindset that embraces challenges. Most importantly, I need to practice patience and resilience when facing technical issues, so that way I can troubleshoot effectively without becoming discouraged.</p>
          <li>Deepen Understanding of Mobile-First Approach & Get in More Practice</li>
          <p>Mobile-first is a lot more challenging but I prefer it because it is more of a "content-first" approach. I like the idea of being forced to prioritize content for the small screen first. This helped reinforce everything I know as an empathetic web professional, that CONTENT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE SITE! It's what people are coming for. Learning about this approached also helped me see exactly where I could currently fit into a web development team as a specialized front-end dev that helps consult the clients, massage content, and focus in on the usability and accessibilty of the content.</p>
          <p>I also appreciate how the mobile-first approach forces you to deal with the more challenging design decisions up front and allows us to write less CSS. Adopting this approach is helping me stick with a process so I can make it easier on my self later on--something I wasn't great at doing.</p>
        </ol>
        <p>I hope to continue these skills this fall through the IT Technical Certification Program. Thanks for the great class!</p>
